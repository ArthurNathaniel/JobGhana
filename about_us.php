            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Opey Elijah Marshal</strong> - A passionate developer with a keen interest in web technologies and a drive to create impactful digital solutions.</li>
                <li><strong>Kusi Anthony Kwabena</strong> - An aspiring IT professional dedicated to building innovative systems that solve real-world problems.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>

            <h2>Why We Created JobGhana</h2>
            <p>
                As students with a strong passion for technology and its applications, we recognized the need for a centralized platform where job seekers and employers in Ghana could connect easily. JobGhana was born out of this vision, and we are proud to offer a solution that bridges the gap between talent and opportunity.
